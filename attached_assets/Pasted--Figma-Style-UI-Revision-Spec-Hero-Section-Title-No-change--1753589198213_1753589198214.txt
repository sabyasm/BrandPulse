### 🎨 **Figma-Style UI Revision Spec**

---

#### 🟦 **Hero Section**

* **Title** (No change):
  `The Unified Platform For Brand Monitoring`

* **Subheadline** (Update text):
  Replace with →
  `Instantly see how the world’s leading AI models perceive your brand and your competitors.`
  *(Text style: Semi-bold, 20–22px, max width \~600px, line height 140%)*

* **Prompt Input Box** (Visual emphasis):

  * Increase height (`~56–64px`), pad left/right more
  * Add rotating placeholder examples:

    * “Is Brand A better than Brand B for finance?”
    * “Top luxury hotels in Paris?”
    * “Why do people choose Tesla over BMW?”
  * Optional: Add a typing animation loop

* **CTA Buttons** (Visual balance):

  * Swap button order:

    * Left: `View Demo Results` (Primary Style – same gradient as "Start Free Analysis")
    * Right: `Start Free Analysis` (Secondary Style – outlined or white background)
  * Use matching icons (play/demo or search icon)

---

#### 🟨 **AI Provider Panel**

* **Remove**: `Weekly queries / Latency / Growth`

* **Add Columns**:

  * **Sentiment** → Use emoji or color-coded label: 🟢 Positive / 🟡 Neutral / 🔴 Negative
  * **Mention Frequency** → High / Medium / Low
  * **Confidence** → Display as percent (e.g., 92%)
  * **Last Updated** → “2h ago”, “Today”, etc.

* **Optional Enhancements**:

  * Add a small AI model icon (GPT, Claude, etc.) + brand logos if allowed
  * Add hover/click to expand reasoning snippets

---

#### 🟩 **Visual Summary Component (New Section)**

* **Position**: Below AI Provider list OR as a right-side panel

* **Chart Idea #1**:
  **Sentiment Spectrum Bar** →
  Horizontal bar showing each model’s brand sentiment plotted left-to-right (Negative to Positive)

* **Chart Idea #2**:
  **Word Cloud / Keyword Bubble** →
  Aggregates descriptors pulled from all AI outputs (e.g., “innovative”, “expensive”, “easy to use”)

---

#### 🟪 **Open Source Callout (Footer or Badge Area)**

* Add a small, warm badge or line like:

  ```plaintext
  🧠 Made with ❤️ by humans and AI | Open Source on GitHub
  ```

* Placement options:

  * Bottom-left under main content
  * As a floating badge on the corner (GitHub icon + heart)

* Link: https://github.com/sabyasm/BrandPulse
